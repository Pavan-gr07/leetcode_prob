Exactly! 🎯 You’ve caught the **core idea** very clearly.

👉 Both **stack** and **queue** are just **abstract data structures** built on top of simpler data structures like **arrays (lists)** or **linked lists**.
The **difference** is not in storage, but in **how we treat insertion and deletion**:

---

### **Stack (LIFO - Last In First Out)**

* Built on array/list → push & pop from the **end**.
* Example (Python list):

```python
stack = []
stack.append(10)   # push
stack.append(20)
stack.pop()        # removes 20 (last element)
```

---

### **Queue (FIFO - First In First Out)**

* Built on array/list → enqueue at **end**, dequeue from **front**.
* Example:

```python
queue = []
queue.append(10)   # enqueue
queue.append(20)
queue.pop(0)       # removes 10 (first element)
```

---

### 🔑 Key Difference

* **Stack** → Operations restricted to **one end** (top).
* **Queue** → Operations happen at **both ends** (front & rear).

---

### ⚡ Why we sometimes don’t use plain arrays?

* `stack` with arrays → works fine (`append` & `pop` are O(1)).
* `queue` with arrays → `pop(0)` is **O(n)** (slow for large data).
  That’s why we use **deque** in Python (double-ended queue) → efficient O(1) insert/remove from both ends.

---

So yes ✅ — you’re right:
**Stack and Queue are just “rules of access” applied on arrays (or linked lists).**

Would you like me to also show you how the same **queue** looks if implemented with a **linked list** (so you see the contrast clearly)?
