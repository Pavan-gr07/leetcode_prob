## 🧭 RECURSION ROADMAP (From Beginner → Advanced)

> Covers all key recursion patterns asked in FAANG / Product-based interviews.

---

### 🧩 **Stage 1: Basics — Build the Foundation**

Learn how recursion *works* (base case, recursive calls, stack flow).
⏱ Focus: Understanding the flow, tracing recursion tree.

| # | Problem                                               | Concept                    | Company Tags     |
| - | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1 | Print numbers from 1 to N (both ascending/descending) | Simple base case recursion | Amazon, TCS      |
| 2 | Sum of first N numbers                                | Return-based recursion     | Accenture        |
| 3 | Factorial of N                                        | Basic recursion            | Infosys, Wipro   |
| 4 | Fibonacci series (recursive)                          | Overlapping subproblems    | Amazon           |
| 5 | Reverse a string / array recursively                  | Recursion on indices       | Google, Flipkart |
| 6 | Check palindrome string recursively                   | Two-pointer recursion      | Zoho             |
| 7 | Find maximum element in array recursively             | Divide into smaller arrays | HCL 
If you want, your next recursion problems can be:

Reverse an array using recursion

Check if a string is palindrome

Sum of digits using recursion

Count digits

Print array in reverse order             |

🎯 **Goal:** Be 100% comfortable tracing function calls and understanding the recursion stack.

### 🧩 **Stage 3: Backtracking — Recursion with Constraints**

Now recursion + decision-making (undo step → backtrack).

### ⚡ Suggested Learning Flow

```
Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3 (Backtracking) → Stage 4 (DP Transition) → Stage 5 (Mixed)
```

### 🚀 Bonus Tip for You

Since you’ve already done Queue/Stack (great progress):

* You can directly start from **Stage 1 basic recursion**
* Spend ~5 days on it (2 easy problems per day)
* Then slowly move to **Backtracking** and **DP**

---

Would you like me to make a **7-day structured plan** (what to solve each day, in order, with difficulty ramp-up)?
That’ll give you a very clear track to follow without burnout.
