# Sum of all Submatrices of a Given Matrix
# Last Updated : 27 Jan, 2023
# Given a NxN 2-D matrix, the task to find the sum of all the submatrices.

# Examples: 

# Input :  arr[] = {{1, 1},
#                   {1, 1}};
# Output : 16
# Explanation: 
# Number of sub-matrices with 1 elements = 4
# Number of sub-matrices with 2 elements = 4
# Number of sub-matrices with 3 elements = 0
# Number of sub-matrices with 4 elements = 1

# Since all the entries are 1, the sum becomes
# sum = 1 * 4 + 2 * 4 + 3 * 0 + 4 * 1 = 16

# Input : arr[] = {{1, 2, 3},
#                  {4, 5, 6},
#                  {7, 8, 9}}
# Output : 500
# Simple Solution: A naive solution is to generate all the possible submatrices and sum up all of them. 
# The time complexity of this approach will be O(n6).

# Efficient Solution : For each element of the matrix, let us try to find the number of sub-matrices, the element will lie in. 
# This can be done in O(1) time. Let us suppose the index of an element be (X, Y) in 0 based indexing, then the number of submatrices (Sx, y) for this element will be given by the formula Sx, y = (X + 1) * (Y + 1) * (N – X) * (N – Y). This formula works, because we just have to choose two different positions on the matrix that will create a submatrix that envelopes the element. Thus, for each element, ‘sum’ can be updated as sum += (Sx, y) * Arrx, y.

# Below is the implementation of the above approach: 

# Here we need to try to solve this question in the Reverse lookup  Technique:

# 1) For a particular element what are the possible submatrices where this element will be included.

# 2) When we get the number of possible submatrices then we can count the contribution of that particular element by doing ( a[i]* total number of submatrices where this will be included) where a[i] = current element

# 3) Now Question comes how to find the number of possible submatrices for a particular element.

#  [[1 2 3]

#   [4 5 6]

#   [7 8 9]]

# So let’s consider the current element as 5 , so for 5 there are (X+1)*(Y+1) choices where co-ordinates of submatrix starting point can lie,(Top Left)

# Similarly, there will be (N-X)*(N-Y) choices where the end  co-ordinates of that submatrix can lie (Bottom Right)

#  Number of choices for Top Left = (X+1)*(Y+1)

# Number of choices for Bottom Right = (N-X)*(N-Y)

# Total number of choices for the current element to be included in the submatrix will be : (X+1)*(Y+1) * (N-X)*(N-Y)

# Contribution of the current element which can be included in all the possible submatrices will be  = arr[X][Y] * (X+1)*(Y+1) * (N-X)*(N-Y)

# where X and Y  are index of the submatrices.
