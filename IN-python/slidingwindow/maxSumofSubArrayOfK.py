# 2461. Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K
# Medium
# Topics
# Companies
# Hint
# You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. Find the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays of nums that meet the following conditions:

# The length of the subarray is k, and
# All the elements of the subarray are distinct.
# Return the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions. If no subarray meets the conditions, return 0.

# A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3
# Output: 15
# Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
# - [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
# - [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
# - [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
# - [2,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
# - [9,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
# We return 15 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [4,4,4], k = 3
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
# - [4,4,4] which does not meet the requirements because the element 4 is repeated.
# We return 0 because no subarrays meet the conditions.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 105

# [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3
