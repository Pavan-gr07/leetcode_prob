# Your current implementation is incorrect because it attempts to compare `prev` (the reversed list) with `original` (the original list) directly, which compares object references rather than their values.

# Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the issues and how to fix them:

# ### Issues:
# 1. **Reversing the entire linked list**: The function completely reverses the list, but the original list needs to be preserved to check if it is a palindrome.
# 2. **Direct object comparison (`prev == original`)**: This compares the memory references of the nodes instead of their values.

# ---

# ### Correct Approach:
# To check if a linked list is a palindrome, follow these steps:

# 1. **Find the middle of the linked list**: Use the slow and fast pointer approach.
# 2. **Reverse the second half**: Reverse the second half of the list.
# 3. **Compare the first half and the reversed second half**: Check if the values match.
# 4. **Restore the original list (optional)**: If needed, revert the second half back to maintain the original structure.

# ---

# ### Fixed Code:
# ```python
# from typing import Optional

# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

# class Solution:
#     def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
#         if not head or not head.next:
#             return True  # A single node or empty list is always a palindrome

#         # Step 1: Find the middle using slow and fast pointers
#         slow, fast = head, head
#         while fast and fast.next:
#             slow = slow.next
#             fast = fast.next.next
        
#         # Step 2: Reverse the second half of the list
#         prev, cur = None, slow
#         while cur:
#             next_temp = cur.next
#             cur.next = prev
#             prev = cur
#             cur = next_temp

#         # Step 3: Compare the first and second half
#         first, second = head, prev  # prev is the new head of the reversed second half
#         while second:  # Only need to compare half the list
#             if first.val != second.val:
#                 return False
#             first = first.next
#             second = second.next
        
#         return True
# ```

# ### Explanation of Fix:
# 1. **Find the Middle**: Use `slow` and `fast` pointers to locate the middle.
# 2. **Reverse Second Half**: Reverse the list from the middle onwards.
# 3. **Compare First Half & Reversed Second Half**: Iterate through both halves to check if they match.
# 4. **Return Result**: If all values match, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

# This approach ensures **O(n) time complexity** and **O(1) space complexity** by modifying the list in place.
