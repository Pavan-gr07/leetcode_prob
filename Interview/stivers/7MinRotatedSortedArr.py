# Pre-requisites: Search in Rotated Sorted Array I,  Search in Rotated Sorted Array II & Binary Search algorithm

# Examples

# Example 1:
# Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3]
# Result: 0
# Explanation: Here, the element 0 is the minimum element in the array.

# Example 2:

# Result: 1
# Explanation: Here, the element 1 is the minimum element in the array.


def minRotaedSortArray(arr):
    #complete the function here
    mini = arr[0]
    for ele in arr:
        if ele < mini:
            mini = ele
    return mini

print(minRotaedSortArray( [5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4]))
